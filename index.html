      <p>Beanie Babies are a line of stuffed toys created by American businessman H. Ty Warner, who founded Ty Inc. in 1986. The toys are stuffed with plastic pellets ("beans") rather than conventional soft stuffing. They come in many different forms, mostly animals.

Created in 1993, Beanie Babies emerged as a major fad and collectible during the second half of the 1990s.[2] They have been cited as being the world's first Internet sensation in 1995.[3] They were collected not only as toys, but also as a financial investment, due to the high resale value of particular ones.[4][5][6]</p>

      <h2>Counterfit Beanie Babies</h2>
       <p>Counterfeit Beanie Babies began to surface in 1997. Early on, cheap knock-offs and fakes of common Beanies were widely available at discount prices.</p>
       <b><p>Cases</p></b>
      <p>Authorities cracked down on counterfeit Beanie Babies in the late 1990s. People were prosecuted for their involvement in the commerce of counterfeit Beanies. In 1998, UK authorities seized more than 6,000 counterfeit Princesses and Britannias.[27] In 1999, a Minnesota man was imprisoned, fined, and put on probation for involvement in smuggling counterfeit Beanies.</p>
