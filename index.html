      <p>Beanie Babies are a line of stuffed toys created by American businessman H. Ty Warner, who founded Ty Inc. in 1986. The toys are stuffed with plastic pellets ("beans") rather than conventional soft stuffing. They come in many different forms, mostly animals.

Created in 1993, Beanie Babies emerged as a major fad and collectible during the second half of the 1990s.[2] They have been cited as being the world's first Internet sensation in 1995.[3] They were collected not only as toys, but also as a financial investment, due to the high resale value of particular ones.[4][5][6]</p>
