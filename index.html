      <p>Beanie Babies are a line of stuffed toys created by American businessman H. Ty Warner, who founded Ty Inc. in 1986. The toys are stuffed with plastic pellets ("beans") rather than conventional soft stuffing. They come in many different forms, mostly animals.

Created in 1993, Beanie Babies emerged as a major fad and collectible during the second half of the 1990s.[2] They have been cited as being the world's first Internet sensation in 1995.[3] They were collected not only as toys, but also as a financial investment, due to the high resale value of particular ones.[4][5][6]</p>

      <h2>History</h2>
       <p>Beanie Babies were first introduced in 1993 by Ty Warner at the World Toy Fair in New York City, New York.[7] It was not until 1994 that the toys were put into factory production, first being sold in local stores located in Chicago, Illinois for around $5 U.S. Dollars. There were nine original Beanie Babies, which includes: Legs the Frog, Squealer the Pig, Spot the Dog, Flash the Dolphin, Splash the Whale, Chocolate the Moose, Patti the Platypus, Brownie the Bear (later renamed "Cubbie"), and Pinchers the Lobster (with some tag errors labeled "Punchers"). [8][9] Since 1994, Beanie Babies cannot be found in larger chain stores, as they continue to only be found in small, specialty stores, such as gift stores and small toy stores. [10][11]

At first, sales were relatively slow, in that by 1995 many retailers refused to buy the bundles the toys were offered in, while some retailers refused to buy them entirely.[12] Yet, around the same time, Ty Warner made the decision to restrict the amount of Beanie Babies that are produced and distributed by the company. This was done in two ways, the first way by limiting the amount of Beanies Babies a store could buy per month, which was 36 of each character.[11] The second way was by "retiring" the characters after a certain period of time, meaning that production of those specific characters would then cease, while eventually new characters would be introduced.[7] As this created an idea of scarcity surrounding the toys, it in turn lead to a significant increase in sales and started the trend of people collecting and reselling Beanie Babies. [13] Their popularity soon grew into a national craze in the US.[12]

In 1996, Ty Inc. released a new product called Teenie Beanies, a miniature cutoff of the original Beanie Babies line. They were sold alongside McDonald's Happy Meals to celebrate that product's 17th anniversary. They also partnered with other companies.[14]

Ty, Inc. stopped producing the product in December 1999, but consumer demand led them to reconsider.[14] Production restarted in 2000 with a Beanie Baby named "The Beginning."

In early 2008, Ty released a new version of Beanie Babies called Beanie Babies 2.0. The purchase of a Beanie Baby 2.0 provided its owner with a code to access an online Beanie Babies interactive website. The website has since been shut down.</p>
